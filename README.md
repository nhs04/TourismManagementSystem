For my Database course, I developed a simple Tourism Management System focused on performing basic database queries. It is designed to manage data related to tourists, hotels, destinations, transportation, and reviews. This project used Node.js for backend development and Handlebars.js (HBS) for dynamic views. The project also incorporated SQL databases for handling and organizing the data.

What I learned:

- Gained hands-on experience with Node.js for building server-side applications.
- Learned how to use Handlebars.js for rendering dynamic HTML content.
- Practiced creating and managing relational databases, structuring data into normalized tables, and executing SQL queries for data manipulation.
- Enhanced understanding of how frontend templates interact with backend logic and databases.
